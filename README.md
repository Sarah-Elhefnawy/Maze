# Maze

1. Game Objective:
The game is a maze game, where the player starts from a certain point on the screen and navigates through a maze-like environment with walls and paths.
The goal is to find a specific exit point.

2. User Stories:
As a player, I want to use the keyboard arrows to move through the maze.
As a player, I want to see the walls of the maze and the open spaces where I can move.
As a player, I want a simple, symbolic representation of the player character on the screen.

3. Design Considerations:
Identify the key objects or classes that may be needed, such as "Player", "Maze", "Wall", etc.
Consider which objects can be combined or merged, and which ones should remain separate.
Use UML diagrams to visualize the relationships and connections between the different elements.

4. Implementation:
Since this is a console-based application, the focus will be on the core functionality rather than complex graphics.
Use the programming concepts and techniques learned in the previous lessons to implement the maze game.
Prioritize creating a working prototype first, then consider adding additional features or refinements.
