# Maze
The project is a simple maze game created using C# and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The game involves a player navigating through a maze-like environment, starting at a designated entry point and trying to reach the exit. The game utilizes basic console-based graphics to represent the maze, walls, and player character.

## Table of Contents
Identify the key objects or classes that may be needed, such as "Player", "Maze", "Wall", etc.
<br>
Consider which objects can be combined or merged, and which ones should remain separate.
<br>
Use UML diagrams to visualize the relationships and connections between the different elements.

## Usage
Player movement: The player can use the keyboard arrow keys to move through the maze.
<br>
Maze representation: The game displays the walls and open spaces of the maze, allowing the player to visually understand the layout.
<br>
Player representation: The player is represented by a simple symbolic character on the screen, such as an ASCII symbol or a simple graphic.

## Game Objective:
The game is a maze game, where the player starts from a certain point on the screen and navigates through a maze-like environment with walls and paths.
The goal is to find a specific exit point.

## Implementation:
Since this is a console-based application, the focus will be on the core functionality rather than complex graphics.
Use the programming concepts and techniques learned in the previous lessons to implement the maze game.
Prioritize creating a working prototype first, then consider adding additional features or refinements.

## Video Tutorial Reference

This project was inspired by a tutorial video created by Piece of Cake Dev channel titled: [C# Level-B][عربى][19 - C# OOP Exercise 2 - Maze game project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YbuM2oPuOA&list=PLfHpC6JZ316f6YXKyux0dHjJXA0Kg38p7&index=19). Apply some of those basic principles and create a maze game. This is new C# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
```
         git clone        https://github.com/yourusername/Maze.git
```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.
